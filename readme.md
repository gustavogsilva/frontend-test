# Front-End Challenge

This project is the resolution of a front-end challenge that consists of creating a landing page with a grid of products, forms and buttons. The main objective is to transform the layout into a functional page by consulting an API.

### Rules

- For each product returned by the API, a product card with the respective information must be created in the product grid;
- By clicking the button "Ainda mais produtos aqui!" the next page of the API must be consulted, generating 8 more products in the existing grid, below the products already loaded by the first requisition;
- The newsletter form with the title "Compartilhe a novidade" must have its input fields validated according to the content (ex: The email field must contain a valid email);

### To run the app

2. Ensure that the layout is 100% responsive;
3. Get the products from the API;
4. Render the products on screen with pagination;

6. Insert functionality to the header menu buttons.
